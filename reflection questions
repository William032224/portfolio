1. How did HTML, CSS, and JavaScript help you build your portfolio, and what challenges did you face?
      These three are the building blocks since these three are needed to create a simple website. The HTML for all of the 
      data and the necessary details. The CSS for the design to make it pleasing. The JavaScript for the button and its 
      functions so that we can toggle the theme to either light or dark mode.

2. What did you learn from publishing your portfolio on GitHub Pages?
      I learned that publishing my portfolio on GitHub Pages can greatly benefit my future. Since GitHub is community-driven,
      my work has a strong chance of being noticed, recognized, and appreciated, allowing others to view my projects and 
      achievements easily.
